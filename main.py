## Loan Comparison Tool - Prodigy Finance vs Brain Capital

Welcome to the Loan Comparison Tool! Please note that this tool is designed for fun and educational purposes only (Also i am in the process of picking one of the 2 for my INSEAD MBA!). It likely contain bugs and hasn't been stress tested. Always consult with financial advisors or loan providers for accurate and personalized loan information.
For the prodigy loan I have used formulas for amortisation found online, additionally i have added the simple interest accrued during grace period + the admin fees. The results have a discrepancy of a few dollars from the values shown on Prodigy.
### Instructions:

1. Enter the variable interest (not APR) and loan amount quoted by Prodigy Finance. The loan amount you enter will be assumed for the Brain Capital comparison.

2. Brain Capital loans are capped at 2 times the loan amount. Enter your expected initial income and how much you expect it to increase over the years.

3. The cumulative graph will show which loan option may be more favorable. Additional detailed individual graphs are initially hidden and can be viewed by pressing the "Show Additional Curves" button.

### Disclaimer:

Please be aware that the calculations and results provided by this tool are based on formulas and assumptions i googled. They may not reflect the exact terms and conditions offered by financial institutions. This tool should not be considered as financial advice. Make sure to consult with financial professionals and loan providers for accurate and personalized loan information.

### Feedback:

If you have any suggestions or would like to see additional features added to the Loan Comparison Tool, please email us at hassnasir95@gmail.com.
